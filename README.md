![](https://github.com/xrisaD/CI-CDPipeline/blob/main/imgs/jenkins-vs-github-actions.png)

For this Demo, we created a simple Node.js application with a simple test. The goal was to compare the two tools, so two CI/CD pipelines have been created. One with Jenkins and one with Github Actions. Both of them are deploying on Heroku.

## Task 2 - Executable Tutorial
### Deploy Serverless functions on Kubernetes using OpenFaas

[OpenFaas](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) is an open-source framework for building and deploying serverless functions with Docker and Kubernetes. You can use it to run Serverless functions on any cloud without being locked-in to third party vendors. In this executable tutorial, we are going to set up OpenFaas, create and deploy our first Serverless function and show auto-scalling.
