### [Comparing two CI/CD tools: Github Actions vs Jenkins](https://github.com/xrisaD/CI-CDPipeline)

![](https://github.com/xrisaD/CI-CDPipeline/blob/main/imgs/jenkins-vs-github-actions.png)

For this Demo, we created a simple Node.js application with a simple test. The goal was to compare the two tools, so two CI/CD pipelines have been created. One with Jenkins and one with Github Actions. Both of them are deploying on Heroku.

## Task 2 - Executable Tutorial
### Deploy Serverless functions on Kubernetes using OpenFaas

[OpenFaas](https://github.com/openfaas/faas)  open-source framework for deploying event-driven functions and microservices to Kubernetes. You can deploy Serverless functions (server-side functions that run on third-party vendors) on any cloud without being locked to a single cloud-service provider e.g. AWS, Google cloud, Azure. In this executable tutorial, we are going to set up OpenFaas, create and deploy our first Serverless function and show auto-scalling.
