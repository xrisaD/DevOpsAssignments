# Automated Software Testing and DevOps

## Task 1 - Demo
### [Comparing two CI/CD tools: Github Actions vs Jenkins](https://github.com/xrisaD/CI-CDPipeline)

![](https://github.com/xrisaD/CI-CDPipeline/blob/main/imgs/jenkins-vs-github-actions.png)

For this Demo, we created a simple Node.js application with a simple test. The goal was to compare the two tools, so two CI/CD pipelines have been created. One with Jenkins and one with Github Actions. Both of them are deploying on Heroku.

## Task 2 - Executable Tutorial
### [Deploy Serverless functions on Kubernetes using OpenFaas](https://www.katacoda.com/chrysa/scenarios/openfaas-tutorial)

[OpenFaas](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) is an open-source framework for deploying event-driven functions and microservices to Kubernetes. You can deploy Serverless functions (server-side functions that run on third-party vendors) on any cloud without being locked to a single cloud-service provider e.g. AWS, Google cloud, Azure. In this executable tutorial, we are going to set up OpenFaas, create and deploy our first Serverless function and show auto-scalling.

### Mergify: Faster & safer code merge
![](https://dka575ofm4ao0.cloudfront.net/pages-transactional_logos/retina/228695/mergify-logo-title-horizontal-w200.png)

Merging can be a time consuming task in big projects with many branches. Handing each Pull Request means assinging reviewers, adding comments, approving and merging. On certain cases the branch must be rebased to the latest verision of the main branch. Mergify is a Pull Request automation tool that solves these issues, through actions that are triggered based on a set of rules. In this presentation, we describe how Mergify is configured, how to specify actions with rules and how Mergify can queue and prioritize merges.

## Task 4 - Essay
**Testing Microservices: Types, Challenges and Solutions**

Testing Microservices Architecture is a trending and challening DevOps topic. In this essay we want to target the different types of testing that can be done within the microservices architecture, the challenges 
of implementing those tests and also present some tools and frameworks that are the industry standard followed to
solve those challenges when we test Javascript microservices.
